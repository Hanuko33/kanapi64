Pre-alpha
=========

* Prepare operating system for children based on Linux kernel and free software for use at home. 
  System should start from USB stick and work on older machines with limited resources too.
* Choose set of educational applications and games for children from existing packages and group 
  them according to the age of child. Projects I've been testing so far contains many applications 
  with different levels of difficulty.
* From many of users interfaces XFCE was chosen by children.
* Prepare framework for creating new applications, so older children can build some new activities.
