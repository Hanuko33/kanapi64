At this moment KaNaPi contains build system to prepare basic system.
It is built from sources by using scripts.

There are 4 steps to create KaNaPi filesystem:
- download sources of packages from sources/RELEASES from SF page
- create FBS - see info in first_build_system/README
- create SBS - see info in second_build_system/steps
- create KBS - see info in kanapi_base_system/steps
